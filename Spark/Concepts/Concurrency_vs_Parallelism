Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.

Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.

Definition:
A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously. The key concept and difference between these definitions is the phrase "in progress."
This definition says that, in concurrent systems, multiple actions can be in progress (may not be executed) at the same time. Meanwhile, multiple actions are simultaneously executed in parallel systems. In fact, concurrency and parallelism are conceptually overlapped to some degree, but "in progress" clearly makes them different.
